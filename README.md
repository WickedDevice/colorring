ColorRing
=========

2 Adafruit NeoPixel LED strips, connected to Arduino board, controlled from a web browser, over Wi-Fi.

Use the web browser to create & send commands to the LED strips, as well as send real-time color data to the LED strips.

This code runs on the Arduino board.  You also need the code for the local web server: https://github.com/briggsm/colorringcc

A tutorial with demo videos, pictures, & a "how-to" can be found here:

This code will NOT run on an Arduino Uno (the code's too big). I suggest an Arduino Mega 2560 or similar.
